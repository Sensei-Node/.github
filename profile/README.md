## SenseiNode

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

- We are an organisation dedicated to driving decentralisation in Latin America. With over $1 billion in assets under management, we are the largest node operator in the region. Our mission is to facilitate the hosting, deployment and management of nodes in multiple jurisdictions, through a network of local hosting providers across Latin America.

- The community is welcome to join us! They can contribute in a number of ways, such as participating in the development and maintenance of our nodes, proposing improvements to our supported protocols, or helping to expand our network of hosting providers. See our [documentation](https://docs.senseinode.com/) for more details on how to start contributing.

- You can find our documentation and resources on our [official website](https://www.senseinode.com/). Here you will find detailed information about our services, supported protocols and how to contribute. We are also active on social media, so be sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/senseinode) for the latest updates and news.

- Did you know that our team enjoys a variety of local Latin American breakfasts? From Colombian arepas to Argentinian empanadas, our diversity is even reflected in our morning meals!
